1. Never trust user input.
2. Don’t assume anything. Don't expect that user will know. Don't expect that anything will work everytime.
3. Avoid tunnel vision
4. Consistency in Syntax and Naming
5. Don't assume anything in general about your program. Always plan as though you may need to return to your code in a few hours, weeks, months or even years, or that someone else will – and document it accordingly
